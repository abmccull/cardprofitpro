## Node.js Module Resolution Error Fix

### Problem
The ebay-oauth-nodejs-client library was trying to use Node.js built-in modules (fs, path) in browser context, causing "Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'" errors and 500 errors on the card-discovery page.

### Solution
Implemented a server-side approach for eBay API integration:

1. **Created Server-Side API Endpoint**:
   - Added `/api/ebay/search/route.ts` to handle eBay API requests server-side
   - Implemented proper token caching and error handling
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for eBay API responses

2. **Updated Client Components**:
   - Modified `search-results.tsx` to use the new API endpoint instead of direct eBay client calls
   - Removed client-side dependency on Node.js built-in modules
   - Improved error handling and loading states

3. **Removed Polyfill Approach**:
   - Deleted unnecessary Node.js polyfill file
   - Removed webpack configuration for Node.js module fallbacks
   - Reverted patches to the global window object

## Select Component Value Fix

### Problem
The application was encountering "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string" errors in multiple components using the Select component.

### Solution

1. **Updated SelectItem Values**:
   - Fixed `search-form.tsx` - Changed empty strings to "any" for condition and "best_match" for sort order
   - Fixed `transaction-history.tsx` - Changed empty strings to "all" for type and platform filters
   - Fixed `search-filters.tsx` - Changed empty string to "all" for sport selection
   
2. **Updated Filter Logic**:
   - Modified filter handling to properly process these new values
   - Ensured default values are set appropriately
   - Updated URL parameter handling to maintain the same UX

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining linter errors in transaction-history.tsx (Badge variant issue)
2. Ensure consistent naming conventions across components
3. Add comprehensive error handling for API requests
4. Consider refactoring other server-client interactions to follow the same pattern
