# Opportunity Score Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to the Opportunity Score feature, including visual improvements to the display and algorithmic improvements to the calculation logic.

## Date
April 2023

## Components Modified
1. Edge Function: `calculate-opportunity-scores`
2. UI Component: `card-profit-pulse-client.tsx`
3. Type Definitions: Added `chroma-js.d.ts`

## Edge Function Improvements

### Scoring Algorithm Refinements
- **Improved Weighting for Components**:
  - PSA 10 Multiplier: 40% (increased from 35%)
  - PSA 9 Multiplier: 15% 
  - PSA 10 Profit: 25% (increased from 20%)
  - PSA 9 Profit: 10%
  - Sales History: 5% (decreased from 10%)
  - Price Point: 5% (decreased from 10%)

- **Enhanced Curve Scaling**:
  - Implemented non-linear scoring to better differentiate exceptional opportunities
  - Added more granular thresholds for PSA 10 multipliers:
    - < 1.5x: Minimal score with exponential penalty
    - 1.5x - 2.5x: Linear increase from 20% to 50% of component score
    - 2.5x - 4.0x: Linear increase from 50% to 80% of component score
    - 4.0x - 5.0x: Linear increase from 80% to 90% of component score
    - > 5.0x: Linear increase from 90% to 100% of component score with cap

- **Score Category Mapping**:
  - Raw scores are now mapped to final scores using these thresholds:
    - 70-100 raw → 85-100 adjusted (Exceptional)
    - 55-70 raw → 70-85 adjusted (Strong)
    - 40-55 raw → 50-70 adjusted (Decent)
    - 25-40 raw → 25-50 adjusted (Poor)
    - 0-25 raw → 0-25 adjusted (Very Poor)

- **Execution & Performance**:
  - Added detailed logging for the Luka Doncic card (highest expected score)
  - Improved batch processing logic with better error handling
  - Enhanced response format with more detailed success/failure information

## Visual Improvements

### Color Scale Enhancements
- Changed from generic color scale to more vibrant, distinct colors:
  - 0-25: Red (#EF4444) to Orange (#F97316)
  - 25-50: Orange (#F97316) to Yellow (#FACC15)
  - 50-75: Yellow (#FACC15) to Medium Green (#65A30D) - previously Light Green
  - 75-100: Medium Green (#65A30D) to Bright Green (#16A34A) - previously less saturated green

- Added gamma correction (1.4) to create more visual distinction between score ranges
- Reduced background transparency from 20% to 15% for better contrast

### Score Display Improvements
- **Score Bubbles**:
  - Increased size from 10px to 11px
  - Changed font weight from `font-bold` to `font-extrabold`
  - Increased border width from 2px to 2.5px
  - Added subtle shadow with `shadow-sm`
  - Increased font size from `text-sm` to `text-base`

- **Average Score Display**:
  - Redesigned with better hierarchy and spacing
  - Added colored dot indicator to reinforce category
  - Used rectangular container with rounded corners and consistent styling

- **Chart Improvements**:
  - Enhanced scatter chart dots with improved colors and 1.5px stroke
  - Set opacity to 90% for better visibility while maintaining distinction
  - Improved tooltips with cleaner design and consistent styling
  - Enhanced chart grid lines and axes for better readability

### Category Thresholds
Updated opportunity score categories to better reflect investment quality:
- 0-25: Low (previously 0-30)
- 25-50: Moderate-Low
- 50-70: Moderate
- 70-85: Moderate-High
- 85-100: High

### Other UI Changes
- Removed redundant opportunity score tooltip since the meaning is self-explanatory
- Added proper TypeScript type definitions for chroma-js to eliminate linting errors

## Testing

The enhanced opportunity score system was tested with the full database of cards:
- Highest scoring cards (like Luka Doncic) now reach the 85-100 range as expected
- Color differentiation is more pronounced and intuitive
- Score distribution better reflects the actual investment opportunity quality
- The visual improvements make the scores significantly more readable across all ranges

## Conclusion

These enhancements have significantly improved both the algorithmic accuracy and visual clarity of the Opportunity Score feature. Users can now more easily identify exceptional investment opportunities with better visual cues and a more nuanced scoring system that properly weights the most important factors for card investment profitability.
